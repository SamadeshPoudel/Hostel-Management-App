## HOSTEL-MANAGEMENT-APP
It can be used by various hostels to manage their day to day task without any hassle. It reduces the communication barrier between the students and hostel management.

In this app: There are separate panels for users and admins.

users can:
1. Request house keeping
2. Request lunch in university
3. Raise a complain / file an issue
4. Pay their fees (This feature will be brought later as I progess in the development)

Admins/Management team can:
1. See all types of requests from users and settle them down.
2. Technically admins will be able to read and update the requests.
